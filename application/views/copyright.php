<p>Counter-Notification Process</p>
<p>If WEDO ENTERTAINMENT receives a valid notification of alleged copyright infringement (the
“Notification”), WEDO ENTERTAINMENT will take reasonable steps to contact the user that
uploaded to APP Wedo Entertainment the relevant allegedly infringing material (the "Material"); and the user may
then submit a valid counter-notification in relation to the Notification (the "Counter-Notification").</p>
<p>During the process, WEDO ENTERTAINMENT would remove the infringing work or disable access
to the work in question until the dispute is resolved.</p>
<p>Please note that WEDO ENTERTAINMENT may provide copies of any Notifications or CounterNotifications to any person where required by law or as otherwise reasonably required by us to
protect our interests.</p>
<p>A counter-notification must include the following information of the user,</p>
<p>1. The contact information, including full legal name (not that of a company), an email address, a
physical address, and a phone number. An authorized representative of the user such as an
attorney shall specify the relationship between the representatives and represented.
</p>
<p>2. Identify the location, including any URL, of the work that has been removed or disabled.</p>
<p>3. The User shall agree to and include the following statement: "I consent to the jurisdiction of the
Singapore courts for the district in which my address is located, or if my address is outside of
Singapore, the judicial district in which Wedo Entertainment is located, and will accept service of process from the
claimant." And the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith
belief that the work was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the work
to be removed or disabled."
</p>
<p>4. The physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or an authorized representative of the
copyright owner. To satisfy this requirement, the user shall type his or her full legal name (not that of
a company) at the bottom of the electronic counter-notification.
Submit the above information to us:  By Email:affairs@wedoentertainment.co. </p>
<p>The counter-notification process may take up to 10 business days to complete, so please be patient. </p>
<p>During this time, the copyright claimant may file an action seeking a court order to keep the content
down. Please note that WEDO ENTERTAINMENT will forward the entire counter notice to the
copyright claimant, including any personal information the user provides and the counter-notification
may be made public. The claimant may use this information to file a lawsuit against the user.
The decision to re-post any work is at Wedo Entertainment’s sole discretion.</p>
<p><b>Note</b></p>
<p>Either the copyright claimant or the user(the alleged infringer), please think twice before submitting a
copyright infringement notification or counter-notice, especially if you are unsure whether you are the
actual rights holder or authorized to act on a rights holder’s behalf. There are legal and financial
consequences for fraudulent and/or bad faith submissions. Please be sure that you are the actual
rights holder, or that you have a good faith belief that the work was removed in error, and that you
understand the repercussions of submitting a false claim.</p>
